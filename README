# Advent of Code 2023 solutions in Rust

Here live my solutions to [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023/),
written in Rust. My only goal for this year is to finish the two problems on each day
synchronously. My goals for this year are NOT to write beautiful Rust code (as I am a
Rust n00b) or to write well-optimized, elegant Rust code (for the same reason -
giving myself grace). Therefore, the code you'll see in here would almost certainly
be unoptimized and decidedly inelegant. Don't judge.

# Running the code

With that disclaimer, running each day's code is pretty simple:

```
cargo run --bin dayXX
```
